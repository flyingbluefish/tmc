1. Register all strings  in hash
2. Synchronize comments and rows with source matlab files (get valid ext)  - done
3. Define correct expression types and create them - done
4. Test all other constructions
5. Test is work when keywords are identifiers or in strings - done

6 . avoid lishie constructors !! - ok
7. check simple assignment - ok
8. Define command options, for comments synchronization.

9. Check all other commands
10 . checjk  matrixes
11. check switchess

tree_decl_elt - in comiler init expr=0
destructor for all command and expressions


1. exit function label: generate and store for return command (now const=1)
2.	~ in lhs support
3. static prefix for local functions and maybe decoration (decoration demands also called function change):
	Decision: local functions should have unique name for all the project. - done
	
4 lsp--> support
5 decrease registers for locals ( correct reset m_max_reg for tmcCreateRegFrame()  ) - done
6 sincronize source code comments for local functions
